# Understanding Tasks in Jira

A task/issue in Jira is the **smallest** step in a process of multiple steps to achieve an outcome. Tasks are generally assigned to one specific person. They have a small duration that is anywhere between *1-2* days. 

Multiple tasks make up a story. A story is a representation of a user’s goal. For example: the story is that a user wants to edit an image on Photoshop. The tasks in this story are the following:

1. Downloading **Photoshop**.
2. Creating an account on **Photoshop**.
3. Watching a tutorial to learn the steps.
4. Editing the image.

## Key benefits of Jira tasks
- Track tasks across its lifecycle
- Comment and tag others to share updates
- Assign tasks to colleagues

Tasks are not always directly related to a user requirement. However, you need to complete it to resolve the user’s requirement.
